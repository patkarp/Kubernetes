A Service Architecture for Eventual Consistency between Two Kubernetes Clusters:

Below service architecture uses eventual consistency between two Kubernetes clusters located in different regions.  We will create a service architecture to 
achieve eventual consistency between two Kubernetes clusters located in different regions. 
We'll use REST APIs over HTTPS to ensure secure communication between the clusters. 

The architecture has following components:
Service A: Primary service deployed in k8s Cluster 1.
Service B: Secondary service deployed in k8s Cluster 2.
API Gateway: This will manage API requests and routes them to the appropriate services. 
Message Queue: Queue to talk and ensure data is consistent between Service A and Service B.
Database: Responsible for storing data for each service. Like PostgresSQL.
Sync Service : This will handle synchronization between service A and Service B to get eventual consistency.

It will work as follows:
We Deploy Service A in K8s Cluster 1 and Service B in K8s Cluster 2.

API Gateway: Deploy an API Gateway in each cluster to manage and route API requests.
Message Queue: Use a message queue service like Kafka or RMQ for synchronizing data between the clusters.
Sync Service: Deploy a Sync Service in each cluster that will perform Data Synchronisation. This Sync Service will listens to the message queue for updates and synchronizes data between Database A and Database B.
Data Flow: When data is updated in Service A, the Sync Service in Cluster 1 sends a message to the message queue.
The Sync Service in Cluster 2 receives the message and updates Database B accordingly, ensuring eventual consistency.
